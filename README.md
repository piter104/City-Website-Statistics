# City-Website-Statistics

Analyze of data which shows the number of hits each page gets on the City of Bloomington website. I have also used this data for a machine learning training. The data is pulled from Google analytics. 

I have also did some cleaning to properly analyze the data.

Open it with Jupyter Notebook!  (Required: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Pyplot)
